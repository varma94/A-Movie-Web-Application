# A-Movie-Web-Application
Develop a web application to get information about movies, their cast, their posters

This application is developed using plain JavaScript and Ajax.  
The data is drwan asynchronously and the web page is never  redrawn/refreshed completely. This means that the buttons or any other input element in your HTML forms have JavaScript actions, and not any regular HTTP requests.

The application has a text section where one can type a movie title (eg, The Matrix), one "Display Info" button to search. 
One section to display the search results.
One section to display information about a movie. 
The search results is an itemized clickable list of movie titles along with their years they were released. 

When you click on one of these movie titles, you display information about the movie: the poster of the movie as an image, the movie title, its genres (separated by comma), the movie overview (summary), and the names of the top five cast members (ie, actors who play in the movie).

I have used the TMDB API to get the required data.
